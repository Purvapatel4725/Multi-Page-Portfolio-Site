                <ul>
                <li id="NetPrjDesc"><h4>As an integral part of the team in Networking course at Ontario Tech Univeristy, I spearheaded a critical project to establish a robust and interconnected network infrastructure for our Univeristy. The project aimed to seamlessly integrate four major cities and the University Of Ontario Institute of Technology, enhancing communication, management, and remote access capabilities across North America, including Toronto, Vancouver, Chicago, and Mexico.</h4></li>
                </ul>
                <li id="KeyCompHeadNet"><h2>Key Project Components:</h2></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><h4>Network Configuration: I successfully configured the Vancouver router and LAN, laying the foundation for the entire network infrastructure. This involved setting up essential network components, ensuring optimal connectivity within the Vancouver branch.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>VLANs and Trunking: In the Chicago LAN, I meticulously implemented trunking, SVIs (Switch Virtual Interfaces), and VLANs. This allowed for efficient segmentation of the network, ensuring security and scalability.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>VLAN Assignment: As part of network segmentation, I assigned VLANs on the Chicago LAN switches, ensuring that each department had its dedicated virtual LAN for improved network management and security.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>EtherChannel Configuration: To optimize network performance and redundancy, I configured EtherChannel between the Chicago distribution and core switches, ensuring seamless data transmission and failover capabilities.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Inter-VLAN Routing: Leveraging the Chicago Router G0/0/0 interface, I set up Inter-VLAN routing, enabling communication between different VLANs within the Chicago LAN.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>IP Address Assignment: I configured client addressing for the Chicago LAN, ensuring that each device within the network had a designated IP address.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Routing Protocols: Implementing OSPF routing based on the specified topology, I established dynamic routing capabilities, ensuring efficient data routing and network resilience.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>BGP Configuration: I played a pivotal role in configuring BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) between the edge routers and the WAN router, enabling secure and optimized connectivity across all CryptoMine branches.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Mexico LAN Connectivity: I ensured seamless connectivity for the Mexico LAN, allowing for efficient research and development operations.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Remote Access Solution: In a critical step for remote management, I proposed and implemented a secure method for accessing the entire CryptoMine network from the virtual Ontario Tech Residence. This involved deploying a robust VPN (Virtual Private Network) solution to ensure encrypted and secure access to all network resources, routers, switches, and devices.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Testing and Validation: Rigorous testing was conducted to ensure the project's success. I ensured that from every end of the network the pings were working.</h4></li>
            </ul>
                <li id="SelPara"><h4>This project showcased my expertise in network design, configuration, and security, as well as my ability to tackle complex challenges in a dynamic corporate environment. By enabling secure remote access to our network, I ensured efficient management and administration of Network.<br>The successful implementation of this project underscored my commitment to innovation, network optimization, and cybersecurity, highlighting my capabilities in network architecture, routing, and remote management.</h4></li>
