                <ul>
                <li id="NetPrjDesc"><h4>I led a crucial initiative to create a strong and connected network infrastructure for our university as a key member of the team in the networking course at Ontario Tech University. In order to improve communication, administration, and remote access capabilities across North America, including Toronto, Vancouver, Chicago, and Mexico, the project sought to seamlessly integrate four major cities with the University of Ontario Institute of Technology.</h4></li>
                </ul>
                <li id="KeyCompHeadNet"><h2>Key Project Components:</h2></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><h4>Network Configuration: I set up the Vancouver router and LAN with success, creating the framework for the entire network system. This required setting up crucial network components and ensuring the Vancouver branch had the best connectivity.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>VLANs and Trunking: I carefully implemented trunking, SVIs (Switch Virtual Interfaces), and VLANs in the Chicago LAN. This enabled effective network segmentation, ensuring security and scalability.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>VLAN Assignment: I assigned VLANs on the Chicago LAN switches as part of network segmentation to make sure each department had a unique virtual LAN for better network management and security.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>EtherChannel Configuration: I set up EtherChannel between the Chicago distribution and core switches to maximise network performance and redundancy, assuring smooth data transmission and failover capabilities.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Inter-VLAN Routing: I set up Inter-VLAN routing using the Chicago Router G0/0/0 interface to allow communication between various VLANs on the Chicago LAN.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>IP Address Assignment: I set up client addressing for the Chicago LAN, making certain that each device had a unique IP address.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Routing Protocols: I built dynamic routing capabilities by implementing OSPF routing based on the stated topology, ensuring effective data routing and network resiliency.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>BGP Configuration: I was essential in setting up the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) between the edge routers and the wide-area network router, providing safe and effective connectivity between all locations.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Mexico LAN Connectivity: I made sure the Mexico LAN was always connected, enabling productive operations for research and development.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Remote Access Solution: I devised and implemented a safe technique for accessing all the networks to Ontario Tech recidence, which was a crucial step for remote management. To ensure encrypted and secure access to all network resources, routers, switches, and devices, a strong VPN (Virtual Private Network) solution has to be installed.</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Testing and Validation: In order to guarantee the project's success, thorough testing was carried out. I checked to make sure the pings were functioning from every end of the network.</h4></li>
            </ul>
                <li id="SelPara"><h4>This project demonstrated both my prowess in network design, setup, and security as well as my capacity to take on difficult tasks in a fast-paced professional setting. I made sure that our network was effectively managed and administered by allowing secure remote access to it.<br>This project's effective execution demonstrated my dedication to innovation, network optimisation, and cybersecurity while also showcasing my expertise in network architecture, routing, and remote management.</h4></li>
